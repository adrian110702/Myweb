# CodeTogether

Add [CodeTogether](https://www.codetogether.com/XaVB/) to VS Code to live share your 
 IDE and coding sessions. Cross-IDE support for Eclipse, IntelliJ, and VS Code. See 
 changes in real time, even when coding in the same file, like Google Docs for your 
 code. So many uses: pair programming, mob programming, code review, project design, 
 unit testing, education, interviews, remote development and more.

_**Free plan with anonymous usage is always available.**_

## Key Features
